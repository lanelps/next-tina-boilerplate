# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Tina CMS Boilerplate

This repository serves as a boilerplate for building a modern web application using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Tina CMS, ready to be hosted on Netlify.

## About

- **Next.js**: A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Tina CMS**: An open-source site editing toolkit for React-based frameworks (like Next.js) â€” it gives your team a customizable editing interface without needing to run a separate CMS.
- **Netlify**: An intuitive Git-based workflow and powerful serverless platform to build, deploy, and collaborate on web applications.
