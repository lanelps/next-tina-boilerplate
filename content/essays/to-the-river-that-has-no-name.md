### 1


My mother died on the sixth day of February, 1997, and before
I sold her house I brought those possessions of hers that I wished to keep to
my home; among them was a large brown leather bag containing letters, cards,
notebooks, and a large manila envelope. I opened it, curious about what I might
find. Still folded, creased, and with the paper starting to look discoloured,
were the letters I’d written to my parents in 1967 and 1968 while teaching for
fifteen months in a small school at Jeogla in the New England district of New
South Wales; there were also letters from my next school at Kunghur, on the
Tweed River, at the foot of Mount Warning. Altogether, there were over eighty
letters. I put them into chronological order and read them. I knew that I had enough
material for a book.


Thanks to Roger Furniss, that book was published in 2014 and
was called *Appointment Northwest,* being a memoir of my appointment to a
one-teacher school, an experience that changed my life and led to the discovery
of people, places and poetry; it was launched at the Polish Consulate in
Woollahra in October and the Reader’s Companion Bookshop in Armidale in
November. Emeritus Professor John Ryan, a former teacher of mine at the
University of New England, did me the honour. There was little buying response
from the public to the book until Andrew Riemer reviewed it in the *Sydney*
*Morning* *Herald* in June 2015; the review was called ‘The Life
Lessons Learnt by an Unsuspecting Teacher’. The same review appeared in the *Canberra Times* under the
heading ‘A leisurely remembrance of a vanished world’. The response to the reviews
was instant and surprising. Telephone calls, emails, letters from people that I
knew but mostly from strangers – men and women who had been taught in a small
school or had been teachers themselves. They came from Sydney, Canberra,
Brisbane, Melbourne, regional New South Wales, regional Victoria, even far
north Queensland, from Townsville, from a man who was a Cowboys fan. All
expressed gratitude for writing about a life they’d experienced once and
thanked me for recreating it for them.


Among the surviving poetry magazines in my library is a copy
of *HOBO**,***Issue 6, August 1995, published by Black
Lightning Press, with guest editor, Kris Hemensley. I’ve kept that magazine for
two reasons. Firstly, the cover poet is Joan Mas, former partner of my first
publisher, Roland Robinson. Secondly, there is an interview/conversation
between Michelle Griffin and Seamus Heaney. When asked about the necessity of
poetry being able to surprise and the teaching of poetry formally, Griffin asks
the question, How do you reconcile that? To which Heaney replies, ‘The writing
of poetry is a mystery.’


After *Appointment Northwest* was published, I left it
alone, remembering these were letters that my mother had saved without telling
me; but also because the book is the story of a family’s loss of a son and my
failure to keep a promise. 


However, five years later I did read *Appointment
Northwest* again; I also
read Seamus Heaney’s interview with Michelle Griffin and something in what I’d written
caught my eye. Alongside certain poems I’d write the word VOICE. It
materialised nearly always next to poems about water as represented by rain,
creeks, waterfalls, mists but especially the River Styx – so much so I began annotating
it whenever it appeared. Halfway through the book a pattern began to emerge; by
the end of the book the pattern was established. A progression of ideas,
expressed through individual poems that are woven in the narrative confirmed that
the ‘writing of poetry is a mystery’ indeed, and one that I believe is also a
gift. By the end of the book I realised I had no need to feel guilty about not
keeping a promise and explaining the details of a family’s loss of a son. The
family, as represented by the mother, would not have minded the story being
told of how their son died, as I would discover. 


I prefaced *Appointment Northwest* with a quote from Alfred Lord Tennyson’s ‘Enoch Arden’, being the story of a sailor who, like Robinson Crusoe, was shipwrecked on an island but who, before he is rescued and returned to England, discovers a world he never knew existed. Mountains, trees, vegetation, birds, and wildlife. He becomes self-reliant, independent. He discovers a New World ‘under the ways to heaven’. An old life is left behind, a new life begun. 


Rain had brought me to Jeogla in 1967, from when it started
falling outside Tamworth, coming over the Moonbi Hills until I reached
Armidale; after two more stops along the way I reached Jeogla in rain that
alternated between downpours and drizzles, punctuated by bright bursts of
sunlight. At more than one place I would slow down and see the road ahead not
as an unending grey strip of bitumen but as a river, a highway of water that
flowed to the east, to the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Often against my
will, but in my imagination, I would force myself to drive into that river, out
of it and alongside it. I would sing or talk to myself for company, for
encouragement. I was following orders, as it were, from an employer, but I was
also following a river that was indicating the direction my life was taking: like
a chick breaking out of its shell, instinctively, just doing what had to be
done without thinking about it.


Often a poem came from a direct argument or conflict that I
had with the voice and there were many of those, a kind of stand-off with what
the voice said I should do – and what I thought I should be doing. The voice
always won. Sometimes the debate came on the spur of the moment. Sometimes it
was after a period of time; after an experience had occurred and I was being
prodded to write about it. Time and place had moved on but the voice, the urge,
the impulse to write became so insistent it could not be ignored any longer.


One Saturday, when the weather was drizzly, I decided not to
go into Armidale but thought I would visit a river that I knew flowed in the
district, a short distance past the school and where I hadn’t ventured by
myself before. Locals often referred to it. The river was called the Styx.


Leaving my car under a tree at a bridge alongside the Styx
River sign I walked over the bridge to the far side. The rain had stopped
falling. Straightaway the air smelt differently; it was more earthy, mossy,
colder than at Jeogla. Stepping down along the river I passed over rocks, wet
boulders, feeling the icy water at my feet. I heard whipbirds, black cockatoos,
saw king parrots in the trees above me, waterhens running in and out of the
undergrowth. The river dipped quickly and I stumbled, standing in water up to
my knees. Smaller birds twittered in the tree tops. From listening to locals
and reading about it I knew the Styx was formed by water falling under Point
Lookout and joining up with the Chandler River, eventually flowing into the
Macleay River and to the east. Trees taller than I could have imagined loomed
over me; it became darker. I could see less of the sun. In parts the river
broadened out, then became more narrow. I saw rainbow trout ahead in a pool,
swimming languidly among floating leaves. I edged forward, not knowing what lay
ahead; but it was more of the same. Tall trees, vines, undergrowth, bird noises
from every direction. I was moving closer to the coast, at times waist deep in
water; but as long as I kept the far bank in sight I knew I was safe. Only when
I saw a sign that read Little Styx River and another that read Wattle Flat did
I stop. It indicated a possible campsite and that might mean people. I still
wanted to be alone. I hadn’t brought a watch and didn’t know what time it was;
but from the position of the sun it must have been late afternoon. The return
journey was uphill and would take longer. I stopped, drank slowly from the
river, and turned back. 


By the time I returned to my car I was shivering. I needed
to dry off and get warm; as I drove in the direction of the school I realised I
hadn’t seen another human being all afternoon. I also remembered I hadn’t told
anyone where I was going.


Inside the school I lit the heater and took off my jacket,
shoes, beanie, shirt, socks and hung them over the backs of chairs. I could put
up with the discomfort of wet trousers and underwear. An hour was all I needed.
I made a cup of tea and sat as close to the heater as I could.


After an hour the schoolroom was warm; I was preparing to
leave when images of the river began to float across my eyes – the leaves,
trees, boulders, stones, fish, as well as images of the New England ranges that
had accumulated in my brain during my stay. 


I heard a voice in my head, the same voice that always brought on the impulse to write, to put my feelings and thoughts into words. Picking up a writing pad and pen I wrote:



> ‘Styx River’
> 
> If time and frost have spared these hills  
> why should hands curb the stream?  
> Deeper than sound in a bone’s hollow  
> has the river cut into this flesh of earth.  
> The waterfall, crashing out of forgotten centuries,  
> throws up an arc from inside the sun.
> 
> In pools of thorn, deep as an eye’s lens,  
> rainbow trout and water-hen glide  
> through ripples of leaves that, once seen,  
> wash into the mind’s sleep, reshaping a dream,  
> unearthing the destinies of voices and stars.  
> Families lie scattered along banks  
> of yellow clay, biding sleep and winds of summer  
> with words the colour of sunflower seeds.
> 
> I shall never walk the bottom  
> to disprove its name and origins – confirming  
> myths of Hades or the stories  
> brought back by people from the city.  
> Let myths and tales remain  
> in the colour and shape of trees,  
> in the sound of hail breaking against granite –  
> sunlight piercing the eyes of trout:  
> winds threading their needles  
> around tableland chimneys and doors.
> 
> Let myths remain, with their gullies and secret ferns,  
> and begin journeys along rivers as this  
> only when conscience and self  
> look to lands beyond the earth of hard flesh:  
> beyond the bridge spanning day and night  
> where Charon himself is a passenger  
> and the mouths of the dead are empty.  
> And you, all journeys ended, knowing time has come  
> for waterfalls to be silent, fall  
> on your knees to drink from the river.  
> As time and frost slowly enter your blood  
> no draught of hemlock could have tasted sweeter.
> 
> 


The poem was a ‘clean write’, straight through, on two
pieces of paper, without a pause. I listened for the voice that had challenged
me, goaded me into writing. I heard nothing. I folded the poem and put it away.
The fire had died down and my clothes were almost dry. I dressed and left.


That night it started to rain, lightly at first, then
heavily and I imagined it sweeping across the surrounding paddocks. I saw it
falling over the forest that I travelled through along the Styx River. This
rain was feeding the creeks and rivers, the tributaries of the larger rivers
that ran into the sea. I was in bed, reading Dylan Thomas’s ‘Manifesto’, being his
reply to a young man who questioned why he wrote poetry. I understood it all,
especially the ending. He said he wrote poetry because of his love of words. *‘Words
were as the notes of bells, the noises of musical instruments, the noises of
wind, sea, and rain…’*

I arrived in Jeogla on Sunday, January 29 1967 and my last
day of teaching was Friday, 15 March 1968. The next morning I left for the far
North Coast, to Kunghur, on the Tweed, to take up my new appointment.


In the fifteen months I boarded with the Sloggett family –
Carrie, Elmo, their son Gerald, and Carrie’s mother, Mrs Annie Williams – Carrie
had become like a second mother to me; in that time and, in the subsequent
years , between leaving Jeogla and completing my Master of Letters degree in
1986 at the University of New England, I visited her while attending
residential schools and sometimes even stayed overnight. On one of these occasions,
in April 1988, she told me the details of Gerald’s death in a Forestry timber
camp in 1972 where he had been working with his father and was hit by the
branch of a falling tree. He died in his father’s arms. Sixteen years it had
taken for her to tell me the details because, she said, in between long, deep
pauses, ‘you have a right to know’.


In my fifteen months at Jeogla I had two of my poems published in a national poetry magazine and I commenced my studies, as an external student, at the University of New England in Armidale. Associate Professor John Ryan was one of my lecturers in the School of Arts and I maintained a friendship with him for decades after graduating with my Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975. Together with my high school English teacher, Brian Couch, he was the most inspiring teacher I had. What I did not know was that I would take Jeogla with me emotionally, psychologically and spiritually. Jeogla became part of my mindset, my thinking, a reference point at which questions of identity, existence and eternity were questioned; it was a sanctuary to shelter in when I felt threatened by forces I could not cope with; it was like I had tapped into a source of purest water, from deep within the earth, that offered itself to be drunk, in the form of poetry to be written.


This experience was best illustrated on the night of 4 June,
2003 when I received a telephone phone call from Carrie’s sister, Olga, in
Armidale to say that Carrie died that day. I had promised her that I would come
to her funeral, but when I asked Olga when that would be, she answered: tomorrow.
By that stage I was teaching at Western Sydney University and explained I had a
lecture and three tutorials tomorrow; I couldn’t make alternate arrangements
that quickly. Why the hurry ? It was the long weekend and the family did not
want to wait until next week. Did she suffer? I asked. No, Olga, replied. She
went peaceful.


Not long after Carrie’s death I made enquiries through the
Armidale and Dumaresq Council to locate the burial details of Gerald, Elmo,
Grandma and Carrie. All were buried in the Presbyterian Section of Armidale
Cemetery. Rows, lots, dates of death and ages at time of death were also provided.


In 2010, I was invited by the English staff at the
University of New England to lecture on my poetry as part of an HSC seminar
being held by the School of Arts. Arriving the day before, I was picked up from
the airport and taken to my motel only to find my room was not ready. It had
been raining in Sydney and it was raining in Armidale. When the rain eased and
my room was prepared I asked if I could be driven to the cemetery. 


It started softly but insistently – that inner voice that I
now associated with Jeogla, Wyatts Creek, the Styx River and Weeping Rock – began
speaking as soon as we entered Memorial Avenue with its red trees blazing in
the cold autumn light. My lift returned to the university.


I found the graves, Elmo and Carrie side by side, Grandma
and Gerald behind them. I took photos of the trees and graves. The voice was
rising in urgency, Write, write while you’re here.


I spoke to Elmo, Grandma and Gerald, one by one, as I would
have when I was living with them.


Finally, I stood at Carrie’s grave and told her why I didn’t
come to her funeral. I apologised for letting her down and asked her to forgive
me.


The only response was from the birds and wind blowing
through the red trees.


Rain started to fall, and a first line came into my head, a
second and third. The poem had arrived with the rain. The voice was speaking
non-stop, Write, write.


Day. Night. Darkness. Light. The time could have been any of
these.


A single impulse drove me.


Hurrying, I left the cemetery, half-running, half-walking
over ground already wet with leaves and flowers, crimson rosellas flying ahead
of me, while the rain got heavier. The words kept coming, images also – as if
my brain had taken the photos it needed to keep the momentum flowing.


The distance was a lot further than I anticipated, and by
the time I got to Room 4 of the Westwood Motor Inn, I was breathless, wet, face
and hands dripping water.


I sat down and wrote:



> ‘Red Trees’
> 
>  Impossible not to see them  
>  once you cross the railway bridge  
>  and enter Memorial Avenue –  
>  the rows of red trees  
>  along the cemetery’s perimeter:
> 
>  maples, claret ash, liquidambars –  
>  cotoneasters where rosellas  
>  hang upside down and feast  
>  on berries like clots of blood.
> 
> The breath of next month’s winter  
>  hangs over them already  
>  but they seem intent on proving  
>  that winter is a lie –  
>  that neither winds nor frosts  
>  are permanent afflictions  
>  and disappear as quickly as they arrive.
> 
>  A family that I once boarded with  
>  at Jeogla lies buried  
>  beside the trees – mother, father,  
>  son, grandmother:  
>  all “born and bred” in New England  
>  where I came to work  
>  and left when the work was done –  
>  where I once considered  
>  settling down but didn’t  
>  for reasons I still can’t explain.
> 
> The mother dead at ninety-three years of age,  
>  the father at seventy,  
>  grandmother at eighty-five  
>  and the son at twenty-four.  
>  On his headstone  
>  it reads, “Accidentally killed  
>  16th February 1972”.  
>  All of them buried  
>  In Loving Memory Of.  
>  What can I do but pray ?  
>  Or be content to live on the memory of a single day  
>  when we sat down and ate a meal together?
> 
>  The wind pauses  
>  and brings a moment’s peace –

>  Leaving a ground strewn

>  and walk back towards the railway bridge.

> 


The poem was written very quickly. The voice that urged me to write had become silent. All I could hear was the sound of rain on the roof. Or maybe it was falling inside me? I found it hard to tell.

By the time I had published *Old/New World,* my ‘New
& Selected Poems’ with University of Queensland Press in 2007, the number
of poems about the Styx River had risen to four; they were spread over forty
years and I would number them, as if to give each one a separate identity; and
yet, as I continued writing in response to the voice in my head, I sensed this
was not the end of them.


Weeping Rock is a cliff formation in the New England
National Park below Point Lookout; while teaching at Jeogla I was taken for a
picnic lunch by the Burleigh family from the Oaky River Hydro Dam at Wollomombi
to the lookout and afterwards, we trekked to the rock, to see this natural
phenomenon, like a prehistoric growth pushing up from the forest floor.


The vegetative growth was reminiscent of the Styx River
environs: tall trees, ferns, vines, mist, birds too numerous to name, sounds
that were primeval yet belonged to the twentieth century as much as we did. Arriving,
we stood at the bottom of the rock and felt its wetness, smelt it, saw the
water streaming down its face. I remember becoming very cold, shivering,
wanting to escape, to leave the place.


In September 1968, six months after the school was closed I
returned to Jeogla. The building was deserted. The keys had been taken away by
Public Works. All I could do was walk around it and peer through the windows. The
yard was overgrown with weeds. Sheep and cattle had eaten whatever flowers were
left growing. The building was a ghost.


But I felt a need to go back and retrace my steps to where I
had been once before, and where I sensed an affinity to, even though the place
held a dread that I could not understand.


When I arrived at Point Lookout the view was shrouded in
mist, moving in from the coast like a form of amoebaean life, settling on
everything it touched. I found the track that I followed with the Burleighs and
was soon standing at the foot of Weeping Rock, that huge wall of basalt that
confronted me as it did before, the same green face – with silver water
trickling out of the earth above me, running over ferns and plant life, trees,
stones, seeping into the earth.


That inner voice was there, suddenly, this time urging me to
hurry back to the car, past the trees and ferns. I took pen and paper from the
glovebox and wrote:



> ‘Weeping Rock’
> 
> Only after reaching the bottom did we stop  
> and listen to the drifting echoes –  
> as long-dreaded farewells when words are lost to worlds  
> in the embrace of death: of flesh with unimagined earth.  
> From cracks and blotched furrows the water  
> trickled silver on to ferns, grass and flowers  
> where, bordered by moss in crevices,  
> icicles remained unchanged from winter frosts.
> 
> A cool spring it had been: and the same now,  
> miles and years and gorges away.  
> The rock’s water seeped noiselessly into  
> the chasm from boulders and forests of gum –  
> streamed, as if the years in grief had come to claim  
> our presence: turn bone to rock and flesh to moss.
> 
> 


Fifty years after leaving Jeogla and the Styx River district
the poems about them continue to be written. Why? Is this an example of what
Seamus Heaney meant by saying ‘The writing of poetry is a mystery?’ Can one
stop it if one tried or will the inspiration, and the desire to write, just die
of its accord? Will that ‘voice’ disappear when it has exhausted itself? I am
now a grandfather, no longer the young man in his early twenties who was sent
from Sydney into the northwest of New South Wales in order to fulfil a contract
that required three years’ country service. Sydney is my home; and yet I cannot
stop thinking about Jeogla and how much I love the area.


I was struck by this dilemma and raised it in a recent poem
, ‘Conversation about Jeogla’, with a friend whose opinions I respect and
value. Why do you think? I asked. In the poem, she replies, ‘Your heart took
root there and is still growing.’


I thought, Can the heart take root  

in the soil of air  

or only from the tendrils of memory ?  

Instead, I asked her, ‘Can I love two places  

equally – Sydney and Jeogla?’  

A mother of twin boys, she replied, ‘Yes.’


If the answer to the number of poems written about the Styx
River in the past could be found anywhere, it lay in the fifth of these,
written on 1 April, 2019 and again, as a response to the voice that urged me to
pick up pen and paper and write. I was sitting in my car outside the school
where my two youngest grandchildren attend, and I was doing the afternoon
pickup:



> ‘Styx River (5)’
> 
> I first read the name at school  
> and researched its origins  
> in books about Greek mythology –  
> as if I needed to discover  
> something essential in my life.
> 
> When I was appointed to  
> Jeogla Public School  
> as the teacher-in-charge, I learnt  
> that a river by that name flowed  
> through gorges and forests not far away.
> 
> I made several trips  
> along the river with the people  
> on whose property I boarded –  
> but one time I went alone  
> knowing I had only so much time to travel  
> and was afraid of getting lost.
> 
> Decades later, alone, I often sit  
> and remember what I learnt  
> about darkness and light, water and stones –  
> the fear that some people call primeval –  
> that clasped my heart like a hand of ice;
> 
> and I wish I could forget its name  
> but know that I never will –  
> because I also learnt  
> that the Styx River was only the first step  
> to the last river that has no name.
> 
> 


I knew I had reached the end of my journey, after fifty years,
the moment I finished that poem. I knew what Plato meant in *The Last* *Days
of Socrates* when he writes about the place to where all the rivers of the
world flow. Seamus Heaney’s comment about writing poetry made sense. There was
nothing else to know.


And yet, and yet (to use a famous phrase of the Japanese haiku poet Issa), it was not the end of the search as it seemed. Ironically, the end brought me back to a beginning, to a memory of rain that fell into the river that has no name before I even knew it existed. This time there was no urgency in the voice, just a request, to reveal the mystery of a poem as it was being born, as it was brought into the light:



> ‘First Night at Jeogla’
> 
> Before going to bed I stood  
> on the back steps of the house  
> that was my new home – under a light –  
> while rain fell out of the darkness  
> on to hills and paddocks I couldn’t see.
> 
> I tried to imagine the highway  
> that brought me from Sydney  
> and wondered how far back  
> the rain was still falling.  
> Had it passed the Moonbi Hills  
> and the forests I’d driven through ?
> 
> Thick clouds hid the stars.  
> A few lights were dots in the distance  
> and these were farmhouses, I assumed.  
> I breathed in the wet scent of the night  
> and felt it enter my bloodstream  
> as if bringing a message from my parents.
> 
> I said to myself, How long can I stand here  
> breathing in the New England air?  
> “As long as you like”, the night replied.  
> The rain kept falling like small diamonds  
> under the back steps light. 
> 
>
